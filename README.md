# BookLibrary

The main purpose of this application is to simplify using the company's internal library. For this purpose, such functionality was implemented - scanning a barcode of a book, displaying information about book, ability to reserve, take, return a book, set rating, write a review and some small features. All actions are editable and returnable. I used GraphQL API with Apollo framework and implemented authorization with Google Sign-In. Everything else implemented on Swift standard libraries. Also implemented VIP cycle from Clean Swift architecture.
