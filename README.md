# BookLibrary

I created this app during EVO Summer Mobile Lab 2019 where I participated as Trainee iOS developer. App developed for EVO.company's internal needs.

The main purpose of this application is to simplify using the company's books library. For this purpose, such functionality was implemented:

1. Scanning a barcode of a book
2. Displaying information about book
3. Ability to reserve, take, return a book, set rating, write a review, add to favourites
4. Search by book name
5. Small improvements such as image caching, error states, 

All actions are editable and returnable. I used GraphQL API with Apollo framework and implemented authorization with Google Sign-In. Everything else implemented on Swift standard libraries. Also implemented VIP cycle from Clean Swift architecture.
